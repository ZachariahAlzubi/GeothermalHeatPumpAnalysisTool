# Geothermal Heat Pump Depth and Cost-Benefit Analysis

## Overview

This project provides a calculator to determine the required depth for geothermal heat pumps based on various heat transfer properties. It also includes a cost-benefit analysis to evaluate the economic feasibility of the system over time.

### Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main script to run the depth calculation and cost-benefit analysis.
- `heat_transfer.py`: Handles thermal property calculations, including thermal conductivity and seasonal variations.
- `cost_benefit.py`: Performs the cost analysis and calculates the return on investment.

### How to Use

1. Modify the input parameters in the `main.py` script, including thermal properties and cost-related values.
2. Run `main.py` to see the depth calculation and cost-benefit analysis results.

### Example Usage

```bash
python main.py
```
